First make sure your current path is in Sokoban folder
We have two choices to run the program

1. Without UI
   Run "py .\main.py"
   Choose map, we have 10 inputs in Inputs folder, you can look through
   Wait for a moment the output will be written in Outputs folder, if you choose input-01.txt the output will in output-01

2. With UI
   Run "py .\ui.py"
   The UI will appear on your screen, click the arrow to choose map then click to the Level button
   In the next screen you can choose the algorithm then click Start button, sometimes the map is kinda hard to solve so just wait a minute while loading screen is appeared
   If the app is not responding, rerun it again
